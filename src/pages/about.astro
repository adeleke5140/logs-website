      <p>Logs provides with you with a proper call log for your IOS device.</p>
      <p>
        I moved over to <b>IOS</b> 2years ago and the experience has been decent
        so far. Sadly, there was one feature that I never liked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The lack of a proper call log.</b> On Android, you can see the total
        number of times a person has called you. Say you wanted to rememeber <i
          >a special call on the 30th of June 2023
        </i> and wanted to know how long it was, you could check it.
      </p>

      <p>Logs is the solution for that lack on IOS.</p>
